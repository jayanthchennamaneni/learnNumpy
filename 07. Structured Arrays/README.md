# Structured Arrays

Structured arrays in NumPy provide a way to work with heterogeneous data types in a tabular format, similar to a database table or a spreadsheet. This feature allows for efficient manipulation and analysis of structured data, including handling missing values and performing operations across multiple fields.

## Overview

Structured arrays are NumPy arrays where each element can have different data types organized in a structured format. This structure is defined by a list of tuples specifying the names and data types of each field.

## Key features of structured arrays:

- **Grouping Data:** Structured arrays allow grouping data of different data types and sizes into a single array.

- **Tabular Data:** They are well-suited for representing and manipulating tabular data with multiple columns of varying data types.

- **Data Analysis:**Structured arrays provide efficient data containers for performing operations on entire datasets at once.

- **Memory Efficiency:** They store heterogeneous data in a compact format, useful for large datasets.

- **Integration:** Libraries like Pandas and scikit-learn can work directly with NumPy structured arrays.

structured arrays can be created by defining a data type with named fields and their respective data types, then creating an array with that data type.

## Creating Structured Arrays 
    
Use NumPy's functions to create structured arrays with specified field names and data types:

    ```python
    # Define data types for structured array fields
    dtypes = [('name', 'S10'), ('age', int), ('weight', float)]

    # Create a structured array with specified data types
    data = np.array([('John', 25, 68.5), ('Alice', 30, 72.9)], dtype=dtypes)

    print(data)
    ```

## Manipulate and Analyze Data in Structured Arrays

Use NumPy's array manipulation and statistical functions to perform operations on structured arrays:

    ```python
    # Accessing fields of structured arrays
    print(data['name'])

    # Calculating mean age
    print(np.mean(data['age']))
    ```
