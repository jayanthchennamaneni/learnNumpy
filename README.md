# Mastering NumPy

NumPy is a numerical computing library that lets you work with n-dimensional arrays in Python.

Why NumPy over Python lists?

# NumPy is Fast:
    The combination of efficient data representation, optimized operations, vectorization, memory  management, and compiled code makes NumPy arrays significantly faster than Python lists for numerical and scientific computing tasks.
